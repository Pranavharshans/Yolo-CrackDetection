# YOLO Crack Segmentation

This project demonstrates the use of **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** for detecting and segmenting cracks in images. The goal is to identify cracks in various surfaces, such as roads, buildings, and infrastructure, enabling automated monitoring and maintenance. **YOLOv11**, an advanced version of the YOLO algorithm, will be utilized for segmentation, allowing for faster and more accurate detection of cracks in images.

By leveraging the power of **YOLOv11** for crack segmentation, this project aims to automate the detection process, making it easier to identify damage or deterioration in infrastructure without the need for manual inspection. This can significantly improve efficiency, reduce human error, and help maintain safer environments.

Key features of this project include:
- **Real-time crack detection**: Using YOLOv11 for fast and reliable segmentation.
- **High accuracy**: YOLOv11 is optimized for precise detection of cracks, even in complex or cluttered images.
- **Versatility**: Can be applied to various surfaces like roads, bridges, and buildings, improving infrastructure management.

This project serves as a foundation for more advanced applications in infrastructure monitoring and predictive maintenance, offering a powerful tool for automated crack detection.
